# **Lecture Notes**

## AWS Snow Family

Purpose-built devices and services to move large datasets into and out of AWS when networks are limited or data volumes are massive.

- **AWS Snowcone:** Small, rugged device (~8 TB). Suited for edge and remote sites.
- **AWS Snowball:**  
  - *Snowball Edge Storage Optimized:* Up to ~80 TB usable storage.  
  - *Snowball Edge Compute Optimized:* Adds powerful compute with ~42 TB storage.
- **AWS Snowmobile:** Exabyte-scale data transfer (up to 100 PB) in a secure containerized data center.

**Snow Family Comparison:**

| Device | Storage | Compute | Use Case |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Snowcone | 8 TB | 2 vCPUs | Edge, IoT |
| Snowball Storage | 80 TB | 40 vCPUs | Data migration |
| Snowball Compute | 42 TB | 52 vCPUs | Edge computing |
| Snowmobile | 100 PB | N/A | Datacenter migration |

**When to Use Snow Family:**

- Limited or expensive bandwidth
- Large data volumes (TB to PB)
- Remote or disconnected locations
- Edge computing requirements
- Regulatory data residency

## AWS Storage Gateway

Hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises applications with cloud-backed storage.

### Gateway Types

**File Gateway**

- NFS/SMB file shares backed by S3 objects.
- Use cases: user shares, application backups, archives.

**Volume Gateway**

- iSCSI block storage backed by S3 with EBS snapshots.
- Modes:
  - *Cached volumes:* Primary data in S3; local cache on-prem.
  - *Stored volumes:* Primary data on-prem; async copy to S3.
- Use cases: on-prem block workloads with cloud backup/DR.

**Tape Gateway**

- Virtual Tape Library (VTL) for existing backup apps (e.g., NetBackup, Veeam).
- Writes appear as tape but land in S3/Glacier.
- Use cases: tape replacement and archival modernization.
