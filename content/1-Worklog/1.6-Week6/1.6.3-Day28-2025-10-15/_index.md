# **Lecture Notes**

## Amazon Redshift

Fully managed cloud data warehouse optimized for large-scale analytics (OLAP).

- Columnar storage, compression, MPP execution; scales from hundreds of GB to PB.
- Integrations: S3, Kinesis, DynamoDB, BI tools; strong security features.
- Concurrency Scaling adds capacity automatically during spikes.
- Architecture: **cluster** (leader node + compute nodes), each compute node has **slices**.

Deployment options:

- **Redshift Provisioned**
- **Redshift Serverless**
- **Redshift Spectrum** (query S3 directly)

Use cases: enterprise BI, data lake analytics, dashboards, trend analysis, forecasting.

**Redshift Features:**

- **Columnar Storage:** Optimized for analytics queries
- **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP):** Distributes queries across nodes
- **Result Caching:** Speeds up repeated queries
- **Automatic Compression:** Reduces storage costs
- **Workload Management (WLM):** Query prioritization
- **Concurrency Scaling:** Handle burst workloads

**Redshift vs Traditional Data Warehouse:**

| Feature | Redshift | Traditional DW |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Setup | Minutes | Weeks/Months |
| Scaling | Elastic | Fixed capacity |
| Cost | Pay-as-you-go | Large upfront |
| Maintenance | Managed | Self-managed |

**Redshift Spectrum:**

- Query data directly in S3 without loading
- Separate compute and storage
- Support for various file formats (Parquet, ORC, JSON)
- Cost-effective for infrequently accessed data
