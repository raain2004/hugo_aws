# **Lecture Notes**

## RDBMS vs NoSQL

### RDBMS

- An **RDBMS** stores data in related tables (rows/columns), enforces integrity constraints, uses SQL, and provides ACID guarantees.
- Popular engines: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM Db2.

### NoSQL Overview

- **NoSQL** systems target un/semistructured data with high scalability and performance.
- Types:
  - **Document** (MongoDB, CouchDB)
  - **Key–Value** (Redis, DynamoDB)
  - **Column-Family** (Cassandra, HBase)
  - **Graph** (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
- Traits: schema flexibility, horizontal scaling, big-data friendliness, CAP-oriented designs.

#### RDBMS vs. NoSQL (high-level)

### OLTP vs. OLAP

- **OLTP**: many small, concurrent transactions; normalized data; short queries; index-heavy.
- **OLAP**: complex analytics over large historical datasets; star/snowflake schemas; read-heavy.

## Amazon RDS & Aurora

### Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

Managed relational databases that simplify provisioning, patching, backups, and HA.

- Supported engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, **Amazon Aurora**.
- Key features: automated backups/patching, easy scaling, Multi-AZ high availability, encryption & VPC/IAM/SSL security.
- Deployment options:
  - **Single-AZ**
  - **Multi-AZ** (synchronous standby in another AZ)
  - **Read Replicas** for scaling reads

**RDS Features:**

- **Automated Backups:** Point-in-time recovery up to 35 days
- **Manual Snapshots:** User-initiated backups
- **Multi-AZ:** Automatic failover for high availability
- **Read Replicas:** Scale read workloads (up to 15 replicas)
- **Parameter Groups:** Database configuration management
- **Option Groups:** Additional features (e.g., Oracle Advanced Security)

### Amazon Aurora

Cloud-native, MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible relational database re-architected for AWS.

- Highlights:
  - Up to ~5× MySQL / ~3× PostgreSQL performance (typical benchmarks)
  - Storage auto-scales to 128 TB
  - Six-way replication across three AZs; self-healing storage
  - **Aurora Serverless** (on-demand capacity)
  - **Global Database** for low-latency multi-region

**Aurora Features:**

- **Aurora Replicas:** Up to 15 read replicas with sub-10ms lag
- **Aurora Serverless:** Auto-scaling compute capacity
- **Aurora Global Database:** Cross-region replication < 1 second
- **Aurora Backtrack:** Rewind database to specific point in time
- **Aurora Parallel Query:** Faster analytics on current data
- **Aurora Machine Learning:** Native ML integration

**Aurora vs RDS:**

| Feature | Aurora | RDS |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Performance | 5x MySQL, 3x PostgreSQL | Standard |
| Storage | Auto-scaling to 128 TB | Manual scaling |
| Replicas | Up to 15 | Up to 5 (MySQL) |
| Failover | < 30 seconds | 1-2 minutes |
| Backtrack | Yes | No |
