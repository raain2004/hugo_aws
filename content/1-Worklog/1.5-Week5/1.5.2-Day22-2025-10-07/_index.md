# **Lecture Notes**

## IAM Policies

- JSON documents defining permissions.  
- Types:
  - **Identity-based policies** (attached to principals)
  - **Resource-based policies** (attached to resources)
- Evaluation rule: **explicit Deny** overrides Allow across all policies.

Pattern to constrain S3 administration:

- Allow all `s3:*` actions on a specific bucket.
- Explicitly **Deny** all non-S3 actions.

**Policy Structure:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
    "Condition": {
      "IpAddress": {
        "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

**Policy Evaluation Logic:**

1. By default, all requests are denied
2. Explicit allow overrides default deny
3. Explicit deny overrides any allows
4. Permissions boundaries limit maximum permissions

## IAM Roles

- Roles provide **temporary permissions** assumed by users, services, or external identities.  
- Common use cases:
  - Let an AWS service act on your behalf (e.g., EC2 → S3 writes)
  - Cross-account access
  - Federation from external IdPs
  - Credentials for apps on EC2 without storing access keys

**Benefits**

- No long-term credentials, short-lived sessions, least privilege, and easier large-scale access management.

**Role Types:**

- **Service Role:** For AWS services (EC2, Lambda, etc.)
- **Cross-Account Role:** Access resources in another account
- **Identity Provider Role:** For federated users
- **Instance Profile:** Container for EC2 instance role
