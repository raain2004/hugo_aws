During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ) - AWS** from **September 8, 2025** to **November 28, 2025** (12 weeks), I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  

I participated in **multiple AWS cloud computing learning tracks and hands-on projects**, through which I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, AWS services implementation, technical documentation, blog translation, and workshop development**.  

### Key Accomplishments

Throughout the internship, I completed the following major tasks:

1. **AWS Learning Journey (12 Weeks)**: Systematically studied core AWS services including EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, and security best practices.

2. **Challenge Proposal**: Developed comprehensive proposals for cloud infrastructure challenges and solutions.

3. **Blog Translation**: Translated 3+ technical AWS blog posts from English to Vietnamese, covering topics such as Amazon SageMaker, EC2 Mac instances, and AMD optimization guides.

4. **Workshop Development**: Created a hands-on workshop on AWS services integration with practical examples and step-by-step tutorials for hands-on labs.

5. **Event Participation**: Attended 2 major AWS events:
   - Vietnam Cloud Day 2025 (September 18, 2025)
   - AWS GenAI Builder Club - AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (October 3, 2025)

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
