As organizations rapidly adopt AI solutions, the demand for [machine learning (ML)](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/) experts continues to grow. According to the [World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2025](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/), the demand for AI and ML professionals is expected to increase by more than 80% by 2030.

To meet this growing demand, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) offers a comprehensive certification path that helps professionals build and validate ML knowledge and skills in building, training, tuning, and deploying ML models.

In this article, we explain how to prepare for the [AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/), whether you are starting from scratch or building on existing AWS certifications. We share the prerequisites and instructions to help you prepare for this certification and demonstrate your expertise in building ML solutions with AWS.

**Four Domains: Comprehensive Study Guide**

[The AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty Exam Guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/onedam/marketing-channels/website/aws/en_US/certification/approved/pdfs/docs-ml/AWS-Certified-Machine-Learning-Specialty_Exam-Guide.pdf?refid=c228b2f7-f72a-429c-a18d-b8304f6391df) provides a blueprint of the certification structure, detailing the four key domains and specific tasks. This document serves as an official roadmap for candidates, outlining the key knowledge and skills required to demonstrate ML competency with AWS.

The four domains are as follows:

* Data engineering (20% of the score)

* Exploratory data analysis (24% of the score)

* Modeling (36% of the score)

* Machine learning implementation and operations (20% of the score)

**Roadmap to ML Specialty Certification**

Starting your journey to successfully completing the [AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/) certification requires a solid foundation. You should have a basic understanding of Python programming and be familiar with basic statistical concepts and ML principles. Becoming an AWS ML specialist can follow a structured learning path, but the certification can be achieved through any learning path that helps you build the necessary expertise.

For candidates who want to follow a structured path, here are the steps to take:

Step 1: [**AWS Certified AI Practitioner**](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/) (CLF-C02)

Perfect for beginners and business professionals, this entry-level certification focuses on practical AI knowledge, foundational concepts, and introduces core AWS AI tools such as [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/), and [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/).

Step 2: [**AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate**](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate/) (MLA-C01)

This intermediate-level certification focuses on the entire ML lifecycle and is designed for those who directly implement, deploy into production, and maintain ML solutions on AWS. It covers everything from data preparation and model training to workflow orchestration and monitoring.

Step 3: AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty (MLS-C01)

For experienced professionals with at least 2 years of work in the ML field, this advanced certification validates expertise in data engineering, analytics, and model optimization.

This path helps you develop both breadth and depth in your cloud computing knowledge and build specialized expertise in ML technologies—skills that are increasingly sought after as organizations continue to leverage AI/ML for competitive advantage.

**Building from an AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate or AWS Data Engineer – Associate**

Whether you come from a data engineering or ML background, Even ML Specialty requires mastering the entire ML lifecycle. Both paths converge at the heart of the ML Specialty in the following areas:

1. End-to-end ML pipelines – Understand how data is processed from ingestion to preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment

2. Production-grade ML systems – Build scalable and secure ML solutions

3. Advanced feature engineering – Create features that improve model performance

4. MLOps practices – Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for ML models

**Prepare for the ML Specialty with a foundation in data engineering**

As a certified AWS Data Engineer – Associate, your expertise in services such as [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/), and data storage options provides a solid foundation for the Data Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis areas of the AWS Certified Machine exam Learning – Specialty. To effectively bridge the gap, focus on expanding your knowledge of ML-specific data preparation techniques, including feature engineering, data cleaning for ML workloads, and understanding how data quality impacts model performance.

Pay special attention to SageMaker’s data preparation capabilities, which may be new to the data engineering toolset you’re already familiar with. Domain 3 will bring in the most current knowledge as you’ll need to develop expertise in algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation metrics—topics not covered in depth in the data engineering certification.

**Prepare for ML Specialty with a Foundation in ML Engineering**

As an AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate, you’re already familiar with SageMaker and the fundamentals of building, training, and deploying ML models. Your strengths in modeling give you an early advantage in most of the ML Specialty exam. However, to excel in the ML Specialty certification, you will need to deepen your understanding of data engineering aspects that support complex ML workflows.

Focus on expanding your knowledge of large-scale data processing systems like Amazon EMR and AWS Glue, which are not emphasized in the associate certification. The ML Specialty exam requires a more advanced understanding of exploratory data analysis, including statistical methods and visualization techniques to discover patterns in large data sets. It requires expertise in optimizing models for production environments and deploying complex MLOps. You should also strengthen your knowledge of operational aspects like model monitoring and deploying ML pipelines at scale.
