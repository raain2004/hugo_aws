The session featured hands-on demonstrations of Amazon Q Developer and Kiro, showcasing practical applications of AI in modern software development.\nAgenda Time Session Instructor 14:00 - 14:15 Welcoming - 14:15 - 15:30 AI-Driven Development Life Cycle Overview \u0026amp; Amazon Q Developer Demonstration Toan Huynh 15:30 - 15:45 Break - 15:45 - 16:30 Kiro Demonstration My Nguyen Key Concepts \u0026amp; Learnings 1. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Overview Core Philosophy The AI-Driven Development Lifecycle represents a fundamental shift in how software is built. Rather than treating AI as an afterthought or simple code completion tool, AI-DLC embeds AI as an intelligent partner throughout the entire development process.\nKey Principles:\nYou Are in Control - AI is your assistant, not your manager. You must maintain decision-making authority over the project direction and implementation details.\nAI as Collaborator, Not Replacement - AI should ask critical questions about your project requirements, architecture, and goals. The collaboration should be bidirectional, with you guiding the AI\u0026rsquo;s suggestions.\nPlan Before Implementation - Always create a comprehensive plan before diving into code. AI can help generate this plan, but you must review, validate, and refine it.\nThe Development Workflow Step 1: Create a Project Plan\nDefine clear project requirements and scope Ask AI to generate a plan based on your specifications Review the plan critically and request modifications Ensure the plan is detailed and unambiguous Step 2: Break Down into User Stories\nConvert the plan into user stories with clear acceptance criteria Divide large scope into smaller, manageable units Each unit becomes a mini-project that can be assigned to team members Estimate timelines for each unit (though be cautious of over-estimation) Step 3: Define Technology Stack\nClearly specify the technologies, frameworks, and tools to be used Instead of telling AI \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t implement this,\u0026rdquo; tell it \u0026ldquo;implement this way\u0026rdquo; Positive direction yields higher success rates than negative constraints Step 4: Detailed Requirements \u0026amp; Design\nWrite requirements with precision and clarity Collaborate with AI to create detailed specifications Define data models, API contracts, and system architecture Create design documents before implementation begins Step 5: Implementation \u0026amp; Verification\nImplement features according to the plan Use mob development approach (team works together on code) Verify all output code as a team Conduct code reviews and quality checks Step 6: Testing \u0026amp; Deployment\nMove through environments: Development (Dev) → Testing (QA) → User Acceptance Testing (UAT) → Production (Prod) Ensure quality gates at each stage Validate functionality before production release Critical Success Factors Create a Plan First - Don\u0026rsquo;t expect AI to handle everything. Always start with a clear plan. Review Regularly - Continuously review AI suggestions and outputs. High error rates are possible. You Are the Manager - Your value lies in code validation and project management, not in writing every line of code. Ask Clarifying Questions - Ensure AI understands your project context by asking it critical questions about requirements, architecture, and goals. Use Prompt Templates - Create structured prompts that include user context, user stories, and specific requirements to get clearer AI responses. Export Plans to Files - Have AI generate plans as files you can save, review, and modify. This creates a living document for future reference. Be Polite to AI - Maintain respectful communication with AI tools. Good rapport may help in future interactions (and it\u0026rsquo;s just good practice!). 2.

Kiro Demonstration What is Kiro? Kiro is an agentic IDE (Integrated Development Environment) developed by Amazon Web Services that bridges the gap between rapid AI-powered prototyping and production-ready software development. It\u0026rsquo;s currently in public preview.\nCore Philosophy Kiro embodies the principle that AI should enhance developer productivity while maintaining professional standards, clear structure, comprehensive testing, documentation, and long-term maintainability.\nKey Features Spec-Driven Development\nWhen you submit a requirement (e.g., \u0026ldquo;add a product rating system\u0026rdquo;), Kiro converts it into: User stories with clear acceptance criteria Design documentation Task lists and implementation plans Structured specifications before code generation Agent Hooks \u0026amp; Automation\nAutomatically triggers tasks based on events: File saves trigger documentation updates Commits trigger test generation Specific actions trigger performance optimization Reduces manual, repetitive work Steering \u0026amp; Project Context\nCreate steering files (markdown) to describe: Project structure and organization Coding standards and conventions Desired architecture patterns Team guidelines and best practices Helps Kiro understand your project context deeply Multi-File Analysis \u0026amp; Intent Understanding\nAnalyzes multiple files simultaneously Understands functional goals across the codebase Makes changes aligned with overall project objectives Goes beyond simple code completion VS Code Integration\nBuilt on VS Code\u0026rsquo;s open-source foundation Import settings, themes, and extensions from VS Code Familiar interface for existing VS Code users Seamless transition for developers Flexible AI Model Selection\nCurrently uses Claude Sonnet 4 as default \u0026ldquo;Auto\u0026rdquo; mode combines multiple models based on context Balance between quality and cost Flexibility to choose different models for different tasks Advantages of Using Kiro Increased Transparency \u0026amp; Control\nStart with specifications before code generation Review and validate specs before implementation Reduce hallucinated code or misaligned implementations Maintain clear traceability from requirements to code Reduced Boilerplate \u0026amp; Repetitive Tasks\nAgent hooks automate documentation generation Automatic unit test creation Automatic information updates Frees developers for higher-value work Security \u0026amp; Privacy\nMost code operations happen locally Data only sent externally with explicit permission Maintains control over sensitive information Extensibility \u0026amp; Flexibility\nIntegrates external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol) Supports multiple AI models Not locked into a single AI environment Adaptable to different team workflows Limitations \u0026amp; Considerations Preview Status - Still in public preview; stability and features may change Complex Projects - May struggle with deep contextual understanding in highly complex projects Supervision Required - Users still need to oversee and validate AI decisions Future Pricing - Expected pricing tiers: Free: ~50 tasks/month Pro: ~1,000 tasks/month Pro+: ~3,000 tasks/month When to Use Kiro You want an AI + programming workflow that maintains professionalism and clear structure Building rapid prototypes but concerned about production sustainability Exploring how AI can become a true programming colleague, not just a code suggestion tool You need spec-driven development with automated documentation and testing Common Pitfalls When Using AI in Development 1. Expecting AI to Handle Everything Problem: Many developers expect AI to complete entire projects autonomously.\nSolution: Always create a plan first and review regularly. AI is a tool to enhance productivity, not replace developer judgment.\n2. High Error Rates Problem: AI can make mistakes, especially in complex scenarios.\nSolution: Implement regular review cycles. Validate all AI-generated code before deployment.\n3. Lack of Clear Requirements Problem: Vague or unclear requirements lead to vague AI outputs.\nSolution: Write requirements with precision. Collaborate with AI to create detailed specifications before implementation.\n4. Negative Constraints Instead of Positive Direction Problem: Telling AI \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t do this\u0026rdquo; is less effective than \u0026ldquo;do this.\u0026rdquo;\nSolution: Use positive, specific instructions. Higher success rates come from clear positive direction.\n5. Insufficient Project Context Problem: AI doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand your project\u0026rsquo;s unique requirements and constraints.\nSolution: Create steering files, provide detailed context, and ask AI critical questions about your project.\n6. Treating AI as a Manager Problem: Letting AI make all decisions about project direction and architecture.\nSolution: Remember: You are the manager. Your value lies in code validation and project oversight, not in writing every line of code.\nKey Takeaways AI is Your Assistant - Maintain control over project decisions and implementation direction\nPlan First, Code Second - Always create a comprehensive plan before implementation\nCollaboration Over Automation - AI should ask questions and collaborate, not just execute commands\nClear Requirements Matter - Precision in requirements leads to better AI outputs\nRegular Review is Essential - Don\u0026rsquo;t expect AI to be perfect; review and validate continuously\nYou Are the Code Manager - Your value is in validation and oversight, not in writing every line\nUse Structured Prompts - Templates with context, user stories, and requirements yield better results\nExport Plans to Files - Create living documents you can reference and modify\nPositive Direction Works Better - Tell AI what to do, not what to avoid\nExperience Matters - Use these tools hands-on to understand their capabilities and limitations\nRecommended Tools \u0026amp; Resources Amazon Q Developer - AI-powered development assistant integrated with AWS services Kiro IDE - Spec-driven development environment with AI collaboration AWS CodeWhisperer - Code generation and optimization tool MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Framework for integrating external tools and services Conclusion The AI-Driven Development Lifecycle represents a new paradigm in software engineering where AI and humans collaborate as equals. Success requires clear planning, regular review, precise requirements, and maintaining developer control over project direction. Tools like Amazon Q Developer and Kiro are enabling this new workflow, but they work best when developers understand their capabilities and limitations, and maintain their role as project managers and code validators.\n"

	"content": "From Theory to Practice Using Amazon Q Developer CLI to Create Customized AWS Projects\nBy Ifeanyi Otuonye and Favour Ezeugwa | on August 26, 2025 | in Amazon Q Developer, AWS CLI, AWS Training and Certification | Permalink | Share.\nDo you have in-depth theoretical knowledge of AWS, perhaps through preparing for AWS Certification exams, but find it difficult to translate that knowledge into practical projects during your studies? You are not alone. Many cloud practitioners face a common challenge of how to move from theoretical understanding to practical implementation ideas. What if you had an AI-powered advisor that could not only suggest projects that match your skills and interests, but also provide step-by-step implementation guidance, helping to bridge the gap between existing knowledge and practical experience?\nIn this article, we will guide you through creating and deploying real-world projects on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Amazon Q Developer command line interface (CLI). By combining the power of AI and CLI, you can build a personalized project generator that understands your skill level and helps you develop practical AWS solutions to add to your personal portfolio.\nWe designed this guide for people who are already AWS certified or who have a basic understanding of AWS and want to gain hands-on experience by building their own project portfolio. This includes people who are already AWS certified or who want to strengthen their practical skills. Through strategic prompts and deployment guidance, you will discover how Amazon Q Developer CLI can serve as both an AWS project advisor and a deployment assistant.\nUnderstanding Amazon Q Developer CLI\u0026rsquo;s Project Creation Capabilities\nUnlike searching through traditional documentation or template repositories, Amazon Q Developer CLI understands context and can generate customized project suggestions based on your skill level and goals. This capability goes beyond concise command suggestions and helps you build a practical learning path that grows with your expertise.\nWhen you interact with Amazon Q Developer CLI, you are using a tool that understands AWS best practices, security considerations, and common deployment patterns. Its real power lies in its ability to provide contextual guidance, explaining not only what to do but also why certain approaches are recommended.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin, you need the following prerequisites:\nAn AWS account with appropriate permissions in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), including AmazonS3FullAccess, IAM role permissions, and Amazon Q Developer CLI permissions (bedrock:InvokeModel and bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream).\nYour local environment should have both AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and Amazon Q Developer CLI installed and configured to authenticate with your AWS account. For installation information, refer to Installing or updating to the latest version of the AWS CLI and Installing Amazon Q for command line. To get familiar with these tools, follow the AWS CLI Getting Started and Amazon Q Developer CLI tutorials in AWS Skill Builder. Using Amazon Q Developer follows a pay-as-you-go model, so monitor your usage through the AWS Management Console to effectively manage costs. Also, refer to the Amazon Q Developer pricing for specific pricing details.\nOnce setup is complete, you will see the Amazon Q Developer CLI chat interface.\nCreating Effective Project Prompts\nThe quality of your project suggestions depends significantly on how you communicate with the Amazon Q Developer CLI. By carefully crafting your prompts, you can tap into specific project ideas that align with your current capabilities and learning goals. For example, if you are an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Amazon Q Developer CLI can suggest projects that build on the concepts of this certification while also providing hands-on implementation experience.\nHere is a practical prompt example for the Amazon Q Developer CLI chat interface:\nYou are my AWS project advisor with expertise in helping beginners\nimplement practical AWS solutions. I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner looking to build my first hands-on projects. Please suggest three beginner-friendly projects using Amazon S3 that:\n1. Build upon Cloud Practitioner knowledge\n2. Follow AWS best practices and the Well-Architected Framework\n3. Are free-tier friendly\n4. Have clear learning outcomes\n5. Can be completed within a few hours\nFor each project suggestion, please include:\n- The main AWS services involved\n- Key learning objectives\n- Estimated time to complete\n- Potential real-world applications\nWhen you send a prompt to the Amazon Q Developer CLI, the response will provide carefully structured suggestions that align with both your certification knowledge and your practical learning needs. From these suggestions, we will focus on the suggested project of deploying a static website hosting, an ideal starting point that combines basic AWS concepts with real-world results.\nAfter submitting the example prompt to the Amazon Q Developer CLI, it provides carefully structured suggestions that are relevant to both your certification knowledge and your practical learning needs. From these suggestions, we will focus on the project idea of ​​deploying a static website with Amazon CloudFront distribution. This beginner-friendly project combines three key AWS services: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for hosting, Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery, and the optional Amazon Route 53 for domain management. With an estimated completion time of 2–3 hours, this is an ideal starting point for combining basic AWS concepts with practical results.\nFrom Project Idea to Implementation Steps\nMoving from idea to implementation requires clear infrastructure definitions. Amazon Q Developer CLI excels at generating precise deployment commands while remaining beginner-friendly. Ask Amazon Q Developer CLI to provide deployment steps using the following prompt:\nAs my AWS project advisor, help me implement a simple version of the static website hosting solution using Amazon S3 from project 1.\nFor each step:\n1. Provide the exact AWS CLI commands needed\n2. Explain the purpose and importance of each command\n3. Include necessary security considerations\n4. Highlight best practices\n5. Mention potential gotchas or common mistakes to avoid\nThe generated response, including CLI steps and commands, demonstrates how Amazon Q Developer CLI can be a learning tool, illustrating how to properly configure an S3 bucket, set up website hosting, and the necessary permissions. It guides you through each command, explaining how the components work together to create a secure and efficient static website hosting solution.\nDeploy and practice live\nWhile the Amazon Q Developer CLI can automate the execution of commands and manage the deployment process, the real learning comes from performing the steps yourself. Let\u0026rsquo;s deploy the first step from the generated response by creating an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, as shown in the previous image.\nTo create your S3 bucket, open a new terminal window. Enter the following command from the Amazon Q Developer CLI-generated step to create an S3 bucket, replacing my-name with your own to ensure uniqueness:\naws s3 mb s3://my-portfilio-site-2025-my-name --region us-east-1\nAfter creating the S3 bucket, continue through each remaining deployment step, from enabling static website hosting to the final step of getting the static website endpoint URL. Make sure you understand the purpose of each command. If you get stuck, the Amazon Q Developer CLI will assist you; if you run into problems or need clarification, ask the Amazon Q Developer CLI for help. It will provide troubleshooting guidance, explaining potential causes and solutions. This process of encountering and resolving issues will be an important part of your learning journey. After completing all the remaining steps to deploy the static website and getting the endpoint URL, copy and paste it into your browser to view your live website. If everything goes well,Well done, congratulations on successfully deploying your first AWS project with Amazon Q Developer CLI!\nInfrastructure as Code with Amazon Q Developer CLI\nNow that you have manually deployed your static website, you can explore other powerful features of Amazon Q Developer CLI, such as creating Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\nAsk Amazon Q Developer CLI to generate an AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) stack that represents your deployment and provides an explanation of its components:\nCreate a CDK TypeScript stack for the S3 static website we just built manually.\nAfter generating the code, please explain:\n- The main components of the CDK stack\n- How each component relates to our manual implementation steps\n- Any best practices or optimizations included in the generated code\n- How this CDK implementation enhances our project\u0026rsquo;s maintainability and scalability\nThe Amazon Q Developer CLI will generate a complete CDK implementation and provide detailed explanations, turning your manual steps into infrastructure as code with additional context. You can use this approach to manage infrastructure versions, ensure consistent deployments across environments, and solidify your understanding of AWS services and IaC principles.\nBuilding on your success\nAfter successfully deploying a static website to Amazon S3, you can consider improving its performance and security. A natural enhancement is to add Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) that delivers website content faster to users globally while enhancing security. To learn how to get started with CloudFront, visit Amazon CloudFront Getting Started in AWS Skill Builder.\nThe Amazon Q Developer CLI can guide you through this improvement. Use natural language to ask it to explain how to add CloudFront to your existing Amazon S3 static website, and it will provide the necessary steps and commands. This improvement will improve your website performance and introduce important concepts such as CDNs, edge locations, and cache behaviors.\nClean up your resources\nAfter completing your static website project, it is important to remove resources that are no longer needed. This practice helps you avoid unnecessary costs and reinforces the cost optimization principles of the Well-Architected Framework. To delete the resources created in this tutorial, you can ask Amazon Q Developer CLI to guide you through the cleanup process using the following prompt:\nProvide the commands in the correct order to help me clean up all the AWS resources we created for the static website project, including the S3 bucket, its contents, etc.\nAmazon Q Developer CLI will provide you with the appropriate AWS CLI commands to securely delete the resource. Typically, this involves deleting all objects in the S3 bucket first, then deleting the bucket itself. If you have upgraded your project with CloudFront, you will also need to disable and delete the distribution. This practice will be useful as you progress to more complex projects with multiple AWS services and potentially higher costs.\nIntegration with AWS Training Resources\nWhile Amazon Q Developer CLI provides robust project guidance, it works best when combined with the comprehensive learning resources that AWS provides. The hands-on experience from this project complements the training courses available on AWS Skill Builder. For example, the Introduction to Amazon S3 course provides deeper context on static website hosting capabilities, while the “AWS Command Line Interface Basics” course helps you understand CLI commands better.\nBuild a learning rhythm that combines project work with Amazon Q Developer CLI and structured AWS training courses. Start with the basics on AWS Skill Builder, implement them using the Amazon Q Developer CLI tutorial, and then reflect on what you’ve built. This approach solidifies your knowledge while creating real-world products for your portfolio.\nConclusion\nThe journey from AWS Certification knowledge to real-world implementation doesn’t have to be difficult. By using the Amazon Q Developer CLI as a project advisor and implementation guide, you’ve discovered a simple approach to building project-based AWS solutions. This approach will help you create portfolio-worthy projects and deepen your understanding of AWS services through hands-on experience. Remember, every AWS expert starts with simple projects like the static website you just deployed following the instructions in this article. As you gain confidence, use the Amazon Q Developer CLI to explore more complex architectures and implementations. The hands-on experience from these projects, combined with the training resourcesAWS, will provide a solid foundation for your learning journey.\nAdditional Resources\nTo continue your learning journey, explore the following AWS resources:\nAWS Command Line Interface Basics\nAmazon Q Developer CLI User Guide\nAmazon S3 Getting Started\nAmazon CloudFront Getting Started\nWe encourage you to start with the static website project presented in this article. Once you are comfortable, upgrade the project with CloudFront to learn about CDNs. Share your implementations, ask questions in the AWS community forums, and keep building. Your next AWS project is just a prompt away.\nAbout the Authors\nIfeanyi Otuonye Ifeanyi Otuonye is a Technical Account Manager and a 10-time AWS Certified professional.

	"content": "Online Library – A Serverless Content Platform for Small Groups 1. Executive Summary The Online Library project aims to build a low-cost serverless platform for storing and distributing content (PDF/ePub) for a small user group (initially ~100 users, primarily students/labs needing controlled internal research-material sharing). The solution prioritizes security, content moderation (Admin Approval), and transparent, linear operating costs as it scales.\nThe architecture uses a fully AWS Serverless stack (Amplify, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, DynamoDB).\nEstimated cost for the MVP (excluding Free Tier) is ≈ $9.80/month, with predictable scaling to 5,000–50,000 users.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Documents and books are scattered; there is no secure content delivery system with access control; the process of adding or moderating user-generated content (UGC) is slow and has high friction.\nThe Solution: Build a serverless pipeline on AWS:\nUsers upload files via Presigned PUT URL to temporary S3; Admin approves → Lambda moves the file to a protected public folder; Readers access content via Signed GET URL (from CloudFront/CDN) to ensure speed and controlled access.\nBenefits and Return on Investment Business value: Centralized content; quality control through moderation; fast deployment with CI/CD. Technical benefits: Very low operating cost (≈ $9.80/month for MVP); scalable serverless architecture; secured content access. 3. Solution Architecture A. High level B. Request flow AWS Services Used Service Primary Role Specific Tasks Amplify Hosting CI/CD + FE Hosting Build \u0026amp; Deploy Next.js, domain management Cognito Authentication Sign-up/Login, JWT issuance, refresh tokens API Gateway API Entry Point Receive requests, validate JWT, route to Lambda Lambda Business Logic Handle upload/approval, generate signed URLs, write metadata S3 Object Storage Store original and approved files, served via CloudFront Signed URL CloudFront CDN Fast content delivery, blocks direct S3 access via OAC DynamoDB Database Store metadata (title, uploader, approval status) Route 53 DNS Domain mapping to Amplify, API Gateway, CloudFront CloudWatch Monitoring Lambda logs, anomaly alerts Search Simple search fields (titles, author) using DynamoDB GSIs.\nComponent Design User Upload: Presigned PUT to S3 uploads/. Admin Approval: Lambda copies file from uploads/ → public/books/ upon approval. Reader Security: CloudFront OAC prevents direct S3 access; reading occurs only through Signed URL generated by Lambda. Search Architecture Simple Search: Design GSI for title and author (example: GSI1: PK=TITLE#{normalizedTitle}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}; GSI2: PK=AUTHOR#{normalizedAuthor}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}). Add endpoint GET /search?title=...\u0026amp;author=... to query GSI instead of Scan. Admin Authorization Use Cognito User Groups with an Admins group. Admin JWT contains cognito:groups: [\u0026quot;Admins\u0026quot;]. Admin-specific Lambdas (exampleapproveBook, takedownBook) check this claim and return 403 Forbidden otherwise. JWT Authorizer (API Gateway HTTP API) handles authentication, while authorization logic is inside Lambda. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases Design \u0026amp; IaC: Use CDK to define all stacks (Cognito, DDB, S3, Amplify, Lambda, API). Upload \u0026amp; Approval Flow: Implement Presigned PUT, metadata (status= PENDING), Admin approval logic. Reading Flow: Implement Signed GET, FE reader stream via CloudFront. Ops: CloudWatch logs, budget alerts, IAM hardening. Search: Add GSI for title, author, implement GET /search. Technical Requirements Entire infrastructure defined using CDK. API Gateway uses HTTP API for cost savings. Lambda (Python) handles business logic \u0026amp; DynamoDB/S3. S3 Bucket Policy must deny public access and allow only CloudFront OAC. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline Platform \u0026amp; Authentication (Week 1–2) Objective: Set up infrastructure and allow user login.\nBackend Tasks (CDK/DevOps): CDK/IaC stack for Cognito. CDK stack for DynamoDB (main table, no GSI yet). CDK stack for S3 (uploads, public, logs) + OAC. Deploy API Gateway (HTTP API) + a test Lambda. Frontend Tasks (Amplify): Configure Amplify Hosting + GitHub CI/CD. Integrate Amplify UI / Cognito SDK for: Sign-up, Email verification, Login, Forgot password. Milestone: git push automatically deploys FE. User can sign-up/login and obtain JWT. Upload \u0026amp; Approval Flow (Week 2–3) Objective: Allow authenticated users to upload files and Admins to approve them.\nBackend (Lambda/CDK): Implement createUploadUrl Lambda: Validate JWT. Create Presigned PUT URL to uploads/. Write metadata (status=PENDING). Implement approveBook: Validate Admin role. Copy S3 file uploads/ → public/books/. Update DynamoDB status (APPROVED). Frontend: Upload form (drag \u0026amp; drop). Upload via Presigned PUT. Admin dashboard with list of PENDING, button “Approve”. Reading \u0026amp; Search (Week 3–4) Objective: Allow reading \u0026amp; searching approved books.\nBackend: Implement getReadUrl: generate Signed GET URL (short TTL). Add GSI for title, author. Implement searchBooks. Frontend: Homepage: book list. Search bar → API searchBooks. Reader screen using the Signed URL (e.g., via react-pdf). Ops \u0026amp; Security (Week 5–6) Backend: S3 Event Notification for new uploads. Lambda validateMimeType: read magic bytes to verify PDF/ePub. Lambda takedownBook (Admin), deleteUpload (auto cleanup after 72h). DevOps: AWS Budget Alerts, CloudWatch Alarms. IAM least-privilege + CORS tightening. 6. Budget Estimation Budget comes from AWS Pricing Calculator.\nMonthly cost (strict, no Free Tier, ~100 users): ≈ $9.80/month.\n# AWS Service Region Monthly (USD) Notes 0 Amazon CloudFront Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.86 10 GB data egress + 10 000 HTTPS requests 1 AWS Amplify Asia Pacific (Singapore) 1.31 100 build min + 0.5 GB storage + 2 GB served 2 Amazon API Gateway Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.01 ~10 000 HTTP API calls/tháng 3 AWS Lambda Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.00 128 MB RAM × 100 ms × 10 000 invokes 4 Amazon S3 (Standard) Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.05 2 GB object storage for books/images 5 Data Transfer Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.00 Included in CloudFront cost 6 DynamoDB (On-Demand) Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.03 Light metadata table (0.1 GB, few reads/writes) 7 Amazon Cognito Asia Pacific (Singapore) 5.00 100 MAU, Advanced Security enabled 8 Amazon CloudWatch Asia Pacific (Singapore) 1.64 5 metrics + 0.1 GB logs/tháng 9 Amazon Route 53 Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.90 1 Hosted Zone + DNS queries ≈ 9.80 USD / month No Free Tier applied Infrastructure Costs This cost model demonstrates the efficiency of serverless architecture: costs are primarily centered on the value delivered to the user (Cognito MAU), rather than paying for \u0026lsquo;idle servers\u0026rsquo;.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Risk Impact Mitigation Cost spike due to sudden user growth High Limit MAU, cache metadata via CloudFront Abuse of uploads Medium Limit ≤ 50MB; auto-delete after 72h Fake/malicious file types Medium S3 Event → Lambda MIME validation Monitoring overload Low CloudWatch alerts, 14-day retention Mitigation Strategies cost: Set AWS Budget Alerts for CloudFront and Cognito. Be aware that Signed URLs have a short TTL and should not be cached publicly long-term; instead, cache metadata/API responses (book lists, details) on CloudFront for 3–5 minutes to reduce API load. Only generate Signed URLs when the user actually clicks to read (on-demand), do not pre-generate for the entire list. Upload: Limit file size to ≤ 50MB for MVP. (Can be increased to 200MB if needed, use multipart upload on the FE to avoid timeouts.) Apply Rate Limit/Throttling on API Gateway for endpoints that create Presigned URLs. Set up an S3 Lifecycle Policy to automatically delete unapproved files in uploads/ after 72h. Add Server-side Validation: S3 Event Notifications $\\to$ Lambda reads magic bytes (e.g., file-type library) to verify correct PDF/ePub; if incorrect, automatically delete and write REJECTED_INVALID_TYPE status to DynamoDB. Copyright (DMCA): Store Audit Log in DynamoDB: uploaderID, uploadTimestamp, adminApproverID, approvalTimestamp for traceability. Build a Takedown API (Admin only): update status to TAKEDOWN; optionally move the object from public/books/ to quarantine/books/ (do not delete completely) to preserve traces. Contingency Plans If costs exceed budget, enable Invite-Only mode to cap Cognito MAU and reduce load.\n8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Fast and secure content delivery (CDN + Signed URL). Standard AWS Serverless architecture capable of scaling to 50,000 users without redesign. Fully automated CI/CD for both frontend \u0026amp; backend. Long-term Value A centralized content platform for structured book data. Continuous documentation of an end-to-end Serverless implementation. Room for future analytics (QuickSight) or AI/ML features. This system proves the ability to build a platform that securely, cost-effectively, and scalably easy by AWS Serverless services - that suitable to apply for small groups or communities.\n"

When scaling Graviton deployments across multiple AWS Regions, careful planning helps you consider regional instance type availability factors and optimize capacity. This article explains how to implement advanced configuration strategies for Graviton-enabled EC2 Auto Scaling groups across multiple Regions, helping you maximize instance availability, reduce costs, and maintain consistent application performance even in Regions with Graviton instance type constraints.\nFlexible Instance Type Strategies\nOne of the most effective strategies for maximizing Graviton availability is to flexibly use a variety of instance types and families. Instance families (such as m7g, c7g, and r7g) group similar instances of different sizes, each offering increasing proportions of vCPU and memory. When configuring EC2 Auto Scaling groups, try to use at least 10 instance types rather than limiting yourself to just one or two specific types. EC2 Auto Scaling supports this flexibility through a mixed instance group, which allows you to specify multiple instance types in the same group. See the example AWS CloudFormation snippet for the EC2 Auto Scaling group [MixedInstancesPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup.html cfn-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup-mixedinstancespolicy), which specifies two Graviton instance types belonging to two different families:\n\u0026ldquo;MixedInstancesPolicy\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;Overrides\u0026rdquo;: [\n{\n\u0026ldquo;InstanceType\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;m7g.large\u0026rdquo;\n},\n{\n\u0026ldquo;InstanceType\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;c7g.xlarge\u0026rdquo;\n}\n]\n}\nThis limited choice significantly reduces access to available capacity pools. Assuming this workload requires at least 2 vCPUs and 8 GiB of memory, you can add the following eight additional Graviton instance types: m6g.large, m8g.large, m6gd.large, m7gd.large, m8gd.large, c6g.xlarge, c6gd.xlarge, and c8g.xlarge. This helps you meet the recommendation of scaling to 10 instance types. While some of these instance types have different prices, you can manage these cost impacts through allocation strategies discussed later in the article.\nTo efficiently identify all compatible Graviton instance types for your workload, you can use GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements. This approach eliminates the manual effort of researching and selecting each individual instance type.\naws ec2 get-instance-types-from-instance-requirements \\ --architecture-types arm64 \\ --virtualization-types hvm \\ --instance-requirements \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;VCpuCount\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 2,\u0026ldquo;Max\u0026rdquo;:8}, \u0026ldquo;MemoryMiB\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 8000}, \u0026ldquo;InstanceGenerations\u0026rdquo;:[\u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo;]}\u0026rsquo; \\ --region us-east-1\nThis example command returns dozens of compatible Graviton instance types from various families (c7g, c7gd, c7gn, m7g, m7gd, etc.), thereby expanding your capacity options. An EC2 Auto Scaling group\u0026rsquo;s mixed instance policy can allow [up to 40 instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_LaunchTemplateOverrides.html API_LaunchTemplateOverrides_Contents), giving you even more flexibility.\nAfter expanding your instance type choices, you need to configure how EC2 Auto Scaling chooses between available instance types. The [OnDemandAllocationStrategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup-instancesdistribution.html cfn-autoscaling-autoscalingggroup-instancesdistribution-ondemandallocationstrategy) in CloudFormation controls this behavior, providing two approaches: “lowest-price” and “prioritized”. With the “lowest-price” strategy, EC2 Auto Scaling will launch instances from the lowest-priced capacity pool available:\n\u0026ldquo;OnDemandAllocationStrategy\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;lowest-price\u0026rdquo;\nThis strategy helps manage costs when you have included multiple instance types. Even with increased instance type flexibility, your workloads will automatically choose the most cost-effective option from the available capacity pools. Alternatively, you can use the “prioritized” strategy if you want more control over which instance types are selected first:\n\u0026ldquo;OnDemandAllocationStrategy\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;prioritized\u0026rdquo;\nRegional adaptation techniques\nNot all AWS Regions have the same Graviton instance types available. Differences in instance type availability between regions create challenges when deploying applications consistently across multiple AWS Regions. To address these differences, extend instance type flexibility beyond the minimum of 10 types, ensuring there are enough options in each AWS Region you operate.\nTo implement this flexibility across AWS Regions, you need to determine which Graviton instance types are available in each target region. AWS provides multiple methods to access this information: check the Amazon EC2 Instance Types by Region documentation for a complete list, use the DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings Amazon EC2 API to determine the available types programmatically, or visit the [EC2 Instance Types page in the AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home InstanceTypes:v=3).\nYou can also run the GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements API on different AWS Regions to understand regional differences. For example, running the same queries in US East (N. Virginia) and Asia Pacific (Taipei) shows a significant difference: over 70 compatible instance types in US East (N. Virginia) and 27 in Asia Pacific (Taipei).\n\\ Query for US East (N. Virginia) aws ec2 get-instance-types-from-instance-requirements \\ --architecture-types arm64 \\ --virtualization-types hvm \\ --instance-requirements \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;VCpuCount\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 2,\u0026ldquo;Max\u0026rdquo;:8}, \u0026ldquo;MemoryMiB\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 8000}, \u0026ldquo;InstanceGenerations\u0026rdquo;:[\u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo;]}\u0026rsquo; \\ --region us-east-1\n\\ Query for Asia Pacific (Taipei) aws ec2 get-instance-types-from-instance-requirements \\ --architecture-types arm64 \\ --virtualization-types hvm \\ --instance-requirements \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;VCpuCount\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 2,\u0026ldquo;Max\u0026rdquo;:8}, \u0026ldquo;MemoryMiB\u0026rdquo;: {\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 8000}, \u0026ldquo;InstanceGenerations\u0026rdquo;:[\u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo;]}\u0026rsquo; \\ --region ap-east-2\nWhen operating across multiple AWS Regions, design a single mixed instance policy that works across all regions by including instance types that are available across all AWS Regions you operate in. Based on the previous query, you can include the following 10 instance types that are available across both AWS Regions: m6g.large, m7g.large, m6gd.large, m7gd.large, c6g.xlarge, c7g.xlarge, m6g.xlarge, m7g.xlarge, c6gn.xlarge, and m6gd.xlarge.\nYou should also deploy your EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for increased fault tolerance and access to deeper capacity pools. To determine which AZs are available in your AWS Region, refer to the Availability Zones documentation or check the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to determine which AZs are being used by subnets using the Amazon EC2 API. Configure the EC2 Auto Scaling group to use all available AZs using the [AvailabilityZones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup.html cfn-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup-availabilityzones) parameter in CloudFormation AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup:\n\u0026ldquo;AvailabilityZones\u0026rdquo;: [ \u0026ldquo;us-west-2a\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;us-west-2b\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;us-west-2c\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;us-west-2d\u0026rdquo;, ]\nBest Practices for Using EC2 Spot Instances with Graviton-Based Instances\nWhile optimizing regional availability and AZ allocation provides a solid foundation, enhancing your Graviton deployment strategy with configuration Amazon EC2 Spot Instances can significantly improve cost efficiency without sacrificing reliability. When using Spot Instances with Graviton, you should implement strategies that maximize your chances of acquiring and maintaining capacity.\nFirst, Spot Instance Advisor provides useful information about the frequency of interruptions of different instance types on AWS Regions. Use this tool to identify Graviton instance types with lower interruption rates in your target regions. Then, expand your mixed instance group to include these instance types. Especially for workloads using Spot Instances, maximize instance type flexibility by specifying up to a limit of 40 instance types for EC2 Auto Scaling groups mixed instance policies. This broad selection increases your chances of finding available Spot Instances capacity.\nIn addition to instance type selection, the allocation strategy you choose significantly affects your ability to maintain Spot Instances capacity. Configure the Spot allocation strategy using the AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup InstancesDistribution property with parameters [SpotAllocationStrategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup-instancesdistribution.html cfn-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup-instancesdistribution-spotallocationstrategy) set is[price-capacity-optimized](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.html ec2-fleet-allocation-strategies-for-spot-instances), to select Spot pools with the lowest risk of disruption while still considering price:\n\u0026ldquo;InstancesDistribution\u0026rdquo;: { \u0026ldquo;SpotAllocationStrategy\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;price-capacity-optimized\u0026rdquo; }\nFor workloads that can benefit from more time than the standard two-minute Spot disruption notification, enable Capacity Rebalancing. This feature, configured via the [AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup CapacityRebalance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup.html cfn-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup-capacityrebalance) property, enables EC2 Auto Scaling to proactively respond to rebalancing recommendations by launching a new Spot Instance two minutes before the running instance receives a Spot interruption notification, thus providing additional time to smoothly transition:\n\u0026ldquo;CapacityRebalance\u0026rdquo;: true\nFor maximum flexibility and better capacity access, consider combining both x86 and ARM architectures in launch templates. While Graviton capacity pools are newer and sometimes smaller than x86, the hybrid architecture approach ensures you can still launch instances even if one architecture is limited. For detailed instructions, see the AWS article: Supporting AWS Graviton2 and x86 instance types in the same Auto Scaling group.\nAttribute-based instance type selection\nWhile mixed instance policies with a list of specific instance types provide great flexibility, AWS also provides a more powerful method for dynamically selecting instance types: attribute-based instance type selection. This method makes management easier by allowing you to specify the attributes your application needs instead of specific instance types, automatically adapting to new instance types, and handling regional availability differences.\nYou can implement property-based instance type selection in the EC2 Launch Template via the [AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate InstanceRequirements] attribute(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ec2-launchtemplate-instancerequirements.html):\n{\n\u0026ldquo;InstanceRequirements\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;AcceleratorCount\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;Max\u0026rdquo;: 0\n},\n\u0026ldquo;BareMetal\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;excluded\u0026rdquo;,\n\u0026ldquo;BaselinePerformanceFactors\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;Cpu\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;References\u0026rdquo;: [\n{\n\u0026ldquo;InstanceFamily\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;c7g\u0026rdquo;\n}\n]\n}\n},\n\u0026ldquo;InstanceGenerations\u0026rdquo;: [\n\u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo;\n],\n\u0026ldquo;MemoryMiB\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 8000\n},\n\u0026ldquo;VCpuCount\u0026rdquo;: {\n\u0026ldquo;Min\u0026rdquo;: 4\n}\n}\n}\nBaselinePerformanceFactors in AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate InstanceRequirements ensures [performance protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.html ec2fleet-abis-performance-protection). This feature ensures that EC2 Auto Scaling groups use instance types that meet or exceed the defined baseline performance. When you specify an instance family like “c7g” as the baseline reference, Amazon EC2 automatically excludes instance types below this performance level, even if they match the other attributes specified. With Graviton deployments, specifying “c7g” ensures onlyselect instance types that have equivalent or better performance than Graviton3 processors.\nProperty-based instance type selection also allows specifying instance types in the template that may not be available in an AWS Region by using [AllowedInstanceTypes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ec2-launchtemplate-instancerequirements.html cfn-ec2-launchtemplate-instancerequirements-allowedinstancetypes):\n{\n\u0026ldquo;AllowedInstanceTypes\u0026rdquo;: [\n\u0026ldquo;m6g.large\u0026rdquo;,\n\u0026ldquo;m7g.large\u0026rdquo;,\n\u0026ldquo;m8g.large\u0026rdquo;\n]\n}\nThis approach helps EC2 Auto Scaling groups use new instance types when available and deploy them automatically in other AWS Regions as they become available. This single template simplifies the deployment and management of instance selection in EC2 Auto Scaling groups across multiple regions.\nSpecial Notes\nThe following special considerations should be noted.\nPerformance Testing with Multiple Instance Types\nWhen deploying instance type flexibility, a common concern is that all instance types need to be tested with the application. Testing 40 different instance types is impractical for most organizations. Instead, consider the following approaches to reduce the amount of testing while still ensuring performance:\nGraviton instance families within the same generation (e.g., c7g, m7g, r7g) use the same processor, providing similar performance. Therefore, you can include multiple instance types from the same generation when testing a representative instance.\nConsider including variants within the family (e.g., c7gd with NVMe storage), as they provide specialized capabilities without changing the underlying CPU architecture.\nFor maximum flexibility, include multiple instance generations.\nIf an application runs well on Graviton3, it will most likely run better on Graviton4, allowing you to specify both in an EC2 Auto Scaling group.\nReserving a Specific Graviton Type\nIf a workload requires a specific Graviton instance type, use EC2 Capacity Reservations, which allows you to reserve capacity for EC2 instances in a specific AZ for any period of time.\nOn-Demand Capacity Reservations (ODCR) are for immediate use and do not require a term commitment.\nFuture-dated Capacity Reservations allow you to specify when capacity needs to be available along with a commitment period.\nAmazon EMR workloads\nAlthough Amazon EMR clusters exist only in a single AZ, you can use Amazon EMR instance fleets to select multiple subnets across different AZs. When you initialize a cluster, Amazon EMR searches across these subnets for specific instances and purchasing methods, thereby accessing a deeper capacity pool. With Instance Fleets, you can assign up to 30 EC2 instance types to each primary, core, and task node group, significantly improving instance flexibility and availability. See also: Responding to Amazon EMR cluster insufficient instance capacity events.\nConclusion\nThis article presents advanced strategies for maximizing AWS Graviton adoption across multiple AWS Regions. You can use the provided AWS CloudFormation examples as templates for your own deployments. Following these practices helps maintain consistent application performance and maximize Graviton instance availability across all AWS Regions you operate, even as Graviton availability continues to scale across AWS\u0026rsquo;s global infrastructure.
